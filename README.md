# 📁 Footprint API examples

This repository contains API access examples in various languages for performing operations on the Footprint platform.

The repository includes folders for examples in each supported language (currently only Python is provided, but more will be listed soon).

Each example performs the following operations:

- 🌟 Create a new co-managed client
- 🔍 Adds a domain to a new scan
- 🔁 Polls the endpoint and waits until the scan is done
- 📊 Retrieves the Technical Report for the provided tenant

This is just a basic example to get you started with using the Footprint API. For more information, see the Footprint OpenAPI schema, or contact the support team at support@codaintelligence.com.
